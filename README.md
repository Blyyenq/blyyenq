##Hello, my name is Francisco

My main interest is medical image processing and analysis. I'm now working on two projects: (1) "Visualization and segmentation of blood vessels in Laser Speckle Imaging images with Wavelets" and (2) "Classification of kidney stone images with Machine Learning". Most of my work has been done in Matlab and I am doing useful things with Python. 

I like very black coffee, the novels of H. Murakami and C. Bukowski. I teach robotics at the university. If you want to discuss things of images, follow me on academic twitter @friscolt, but also.
