# import Francisco as friscolt

My main interest is medical image processing and analysis. This involves multidisciplinary research from computing (mainly), and a bit of biophotonics. Most of my work has been done in Matlab, and I'm doing useful things with Python 🐍.

I'm now working on two interesting projects:

*  [**Visualization and localization of blood vessels in speckle images**](/pages/bloodvessels)
*  **Classification of kidney stones in endoscopic images**

If you want to know more about the contributions in these projects, you can click on the points above.

If you want to discuss things of images, or make a collaboration, send me an [email](mailto:francisco.lopez@inaoe.com?subject=[GitHub]%20Hello,%20Francisco), or follow me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/Friscolt).

Cheers,
Francisco 🇲🇽
