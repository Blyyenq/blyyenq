# Hello, my name is Francisco 👨🏾‍💻

My main interest is medical image processing and analysis 📈⛏️. This involves multidisciplinary research from computing (mainly), and a bit of physics (biophotonics). Most of my work has been done in Matlab, and I'm doing useful things with Python 🐍. 

I'm now working on two interesting projects: 
  1. Visualization and localization of *blood vessels images* with wavelets
  2. Classification of *kidney stone images* with machine and deep learning

I like very black [coffee](https://twitter.com/Blyyenq/status/1279272826726305793?s=20)☕, novels of [Murakami](https://twitter.com/Blyyenq/status/1213678392039505922?s=20), and [RHCP music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5ht7o5r4iQ) 🎵. 
Currently, I teach robotics at the university 🤖📚. 

If you want to discuss things of images, follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Friscolt).

Cheers, 
Francisco 🇲🇽
