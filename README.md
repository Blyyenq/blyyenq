# Hello, my name is Francisco 👨🏾‍💻

My main interest is medical image processing and analysis. This involves multidisciplinary research from computing (mainly), and a bit of biophotonics. Most of my work has been done in Matlab, and I'm doing useful things with Python 🐍.

I'm now working on two interesting projects:

* Visualization and localization of *blood vessels images*
* Classification of *kidney stone images*

If you want to discuss things of images, or make a collaboration, send me an [email](mailto:francisco.lopez@inaoe.com?subject=[GitHub]%20Hello,%20Francisco), or follow me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/Friscolt).

Cheers,
Francisco 🇲🇽
