# Hello, my name is Francisco 👨🏾‍💻

My main interest is medical image processing and analysis 📈⛏️. This involves multidisciplinary research from computing (mainly), and a bit of physics (biophotonics). Most of my work has been done in Matlab, and I'm doing useful things with Python 🐍. 

I'm now working on two interesing projects: 
  1. "Visualization and segmentation of blood vessels in Laser Speckle Imaging images with Wavelets"
  2. "Classification of kidney stone images with Machine Learning"

I like very black coffee ☕, the novels of H. Murakami and C. Bukowski. I teach robotics at the university 🤖 📚 🎒. If you want to discuss things of images, follow me on academic twitter @friscolt, but also. 

Francisco 🇲🇽
