# Hello, my name is Francisco 👨🏾‍💻

My main interest is medical image processing and analysis 📈⛏️. This involves multidisciplinary research from computing (mainly), and a bit of physics (biophotonics). Most of my work has been done in Matlab, and I'm doing useful things with Python 🐍. 

I'm now working on two interesting projects: 
  1. Visualization and segmentation of *blood vessels images* with Wavelets
  2. Classification of *kidney stone images* with Machine/Deep Learning

I like very black coffee ☕, novels of Murakami and C. Bukowski, and [RHCP music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5ht7o5r4iQ) 🎵. Currently, I teach robotics at the university 🤖 📚 🎒. 
If you want to discuss things of images, follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Friscolt), but also. 

Cheers, Francisco 🇲🇽
