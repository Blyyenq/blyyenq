# Hello, my name is Francisco 🇲🇽

My main interest is medical image processing and analysis 👨🏾‍💻 📈 .Most of my work has been done in Matlab, and I'm doing useful things with Python 🐍. 

I'm now working on two interesing projects: 
1.  📓 "Visualization and segmentation of blood vessels in Laser Speckle Imaging images with Wavelets", and 
2. 📓 "Classification of kidney stone images with Machine Learning". 

I like very black coffee ☕, the novels of H. Murakami and C. Bukowski 📚. I teach robotics at the university 🤖 📚 🎒. If you want to discuss things of images, follow me on academic twitter @friscolt, but also.
